1. App / Client Plane

This is what your users interact with.

User tasks and typed requests

Identity + intent capture

SLA and priority indicators
➡️ This plane does not have direct tool access.

2. Agent Control Plane (Runtime)

This is the brain of the agent.

It handles:

✔ Orchestration (state machine)
✔ Workflow state store (deterministic)
✔ Policy and budgets (rate limits, cost caps)
✔ Retry/Idempotency & tool gating
✔ Step, progress, stop conditions

Its role is to convert request + identity context into plan + results.

3. Model Plane

This is where the LLMs live.

General LLMs — reasoning & generation

Optional specialist LLMs

Optional embeddings & reranker

📌 Models do not call tools directly — everything goes through governance.

4. Tool Plane (MCP Gateway)

Manages access to external tools:

Tool registry

Allowlists & scopes

Authorization per tool

Audit logs for every invocation

Principles emphasized: least privilege, deny by default, tool contracts.

5. Internal Data & Systems

Trusted internal sources the agent can use:

Ticketing / ITSM

Knowledge base / search

Databases / queues

Workflows / runbooks

Results and metadata go back into the agent.

6. External Web Access (Optional)

If the agent needs to use the web:

Domain allowlist

Content sanitization

Prompt-injection defenses

Rate limits + timeouts

Treated as untrusted input — outputs should be text with citations.
