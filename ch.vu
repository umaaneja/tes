Title: "Ready-Made AI Agents for Life Sciences: Multi-LLM Flexibility & Enterprise Scalability"
Subtitle: "Accelerating Drug Discovery, Clinical Research & Compliance with Pre-Built AI"
Visual: Abstract AI/life science imagery (e.g., DNA helix + robots).

Slide 2: Problem Statement
Header: "Challenges in Life Sciences AI Adoption"
Bullet Points:

Vendor lock-in with single-LLM solutions.

High costs of custom AI development.

Lack of domain-specific fine-tuning (e.g., for FDA/EMA compliance).

Slow deployment timelines.

Slide 3: Solution Overview
Header: "Pre-Built, Multi-LLM AI Agents"
Key Features:
✅ Plug-and-play agents for life science workflows.
✅ Dynamic LLM routing (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
✅ Pre-configured compliance (HIPAA/GDPR).
✅ Modular design for scalability.
